I am a little concerned about this system. I don't know if it this takes into account people are in their very last semester. I would really like Generative Data Modeling as it relates to be major of Biochemistry, and biology where generative biology is becoming a huge field. This is my last chance to take the course, so I would like to meet with you if you would like to discuss this. I am just little concerned thinking I would be choosing first as a senior and left my last CS course to Spring 2024 for my minor. ",1,,I have read and agree to the above statement.,
